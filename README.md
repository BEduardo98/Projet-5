# Projet-5-Kanap #

I'm working at a web agency. My new client Kanap want to have a e-commerce platforme.

In our agency we are three developpers :
- Franck, the frontend developper, did the static integration of the website ;
- Bilal , the backend developper , did the integration of the API who is connected to the front;
- Me, I made the integration of dynamic elements with JavaScript.

This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
